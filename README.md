# Autonomous vehicle
## General Info
For my first semester programming project, i designed an autonomous vehicle using Arduino UNO and his sensors itself.

The vehicle can be used via bluetooth on our phones and it can detect red light which defines his movements.

If the color is red, the car stops even thought the user sends commands for the vehicle to move. As soon as red light disappears the vehicle can move.

## Hardware
The sensors that I used are HC-06 Bluetooth sensor which is a slave module.

I used TCS 3200 which is a color sensor. 

Finally for controling the motors, I used HW-095 motor module.

The chasis that i used was an old one from an old school project. It was made from plexiglass.

## Software

As software, I programmed my robot with Arduino IDE.
